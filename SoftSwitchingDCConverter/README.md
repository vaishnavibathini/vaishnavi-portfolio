# Efficient Soft-Switching DC-DC Converter for MPPT

Designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink, this project compares **Cuk vs Buck-Boost converters** under soft-switching to improve **solar energy efficiency** via MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking).

##  Key Objectives
- Reduce switching losses and ripples
- Achieve Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS)
- Evaluate energy transfer in PV-grid systems

##  Tech Stack
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Power Electronics

##  Results
- Cuk converter provided smoother output and better efficiency
- Identified suitable models for real-world solar integration
