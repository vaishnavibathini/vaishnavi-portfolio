# Intelligent Traffic Control System using PLC

A diploma-level automation project using **Omron PLC and Ladder Logic** for traffic light control at a four-way junction. Enhanced with a proposal for ML-based dynamic congestion handling.

##  Project Scope
- Four-lane model with limit switches as vehicle sensors
- Logic programmed via CX-Programmer software
- Ladder diagram-based control system
- Prioritized lanes based on traffic density

##  Future Enhancements
- Integrate ML to adapt signal timing
- Add IoT cameras or loop sensors for live data
- Sync with Google Maps for smart rerouting
